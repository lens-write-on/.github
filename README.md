## **Write. Contribute. Earn — powered by Web3 & AI.**

WriteOn is a next-generation, write-to-earn platform that connects writers with crypto-funded campaigns. Writers submit content for campaigns created by DAOs, brands, and influencers — and get rewarded based on AI-powered quality scoring and performance.

"**Whether you're a skilled writer or a project looking to go viral, WriteOn bridges both worlds with a fair, transparent, and onchain reward model**"

## 🤔 Problem
- Web3 Projects struggle to run content campaigns that are cost-efficient and measurable.
- Writers (Web2 & Web3) are stuck between underpaying platforms and random airdrops.
- Content quality is hard to judge objectively, leading to low trust and wasted budgets.

## 💡 Solution
A two-sided platform where:
- Writers earn from writing high-quality, campaign-aligned content.
- Campaign creators pay only for performance, verified by AI.
- AI scores content for virality, clarity, and alignment — a new benchmark for quality.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI Content Scoring** – Writers are rewarded based on clarity, originality, and virality.
- **Campaign Creation** – Campaign creators define goals, fund prize pools, and review entries.
- **Wallet-based Auth** – No email/password needed. Fully Web3-native.
- **Creator Analytics** – Track submissions, content reach, and ROI in one dashboard.
- **Token Rewards** – Writers receive tokens for accepted and high-performing content.
- **Fair & Transparent** – Built with smart contracts and AI scoring logic on Pharos Network.
